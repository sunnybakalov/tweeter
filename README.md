# Twitter

### I am recreating Twitter using GraphQL, Elixir, React, Apollo, and Absinthe.

This is a personal project where my goal is to learn how these languages & frameworks all work together seamlessly.

Some goals include:
 - Have a functional version that uses G raphQL subscriptions for real time Tweet updates.
 - Proper authentication on the backend.
 - Recreate Twitter's UI with React.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
